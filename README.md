Intro
=================

Email is broken. We get too much of it. We get irrelevant stuff. Reply-all is the default and CC is the norm. Even worse, smart phones constantly interrupt our day with every single message with almost no intelligence involved. How do we sort through the email and make sure we get the important information in a timely manner in a way we can use? Recently I discovered Context.io API and saw a light at the end of the tunnel.

In brief, Context.io is an API for your email inbox. After creating an account and synchronizing it to your account, you can retrieve any email, sort through them by date, sending, content, or a variety of other things. More importantly, you can create webhooks to trigger events as things occur within your inbox. Just like Twilio, they abstract the complicated details away under a much simpler interface. More importantly, by combining Twilio and Context.io, you can have an intelligent inbox that enables you to filter out the important details and ignore the rest.
